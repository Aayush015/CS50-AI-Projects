# Traffic Sign Recognition Neural Network

## Experiment Process

In the first model, I used two convolutin layer with 32 and 64 filters. There was issue with overfitting as the training accuracy was higher than testing accuracy. <br>


I then added third convolution layer with 128 filters, which improved model's ability, leading to better test accuracy. Training time slightly increased.
