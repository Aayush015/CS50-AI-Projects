# CS50 AI Course: Problem Set 0

This repository contains solutions to **Problem Set 0** of **CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python**. It includes:

1. **Degrees of Separation**: Find the shortest connection between two actors through movies using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.
2. **Tic-Tac-Toe with AI**: Play Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI that uses the **Minimax algorithm** to always play optimally.

## **Degrees of Separation**

This project finds the shortest path between two actors using a graph where:
- **Nodes** represent actors.
- **Edges** represent movies connecting actors.
