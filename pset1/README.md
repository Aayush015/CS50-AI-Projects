# CS50 AI Course: Problem Set 1

This repository contains solutions to **Problem Set 1** of **CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python**, which includes two projects:

1. **Knights**: Solves logical puzzles involving "Knights and Knaves" using propositional logic and model checking.
2. **Minesweeper**: Implements an AI agent that plays Minesweeper by using logical inference to deduce safe cells and mine locations.

## Projects

### **1. Knights**

- **Goal**: Solve puzzles where characters (Knights who always tell the truth, and Knaves who always lie) make statements.
- **Core Files**:
  - `logic.py`: Defines the logical framework and model checking engine.
  - `puzzle.py`: Defines the knowledge bases for the puzzles and solves them using model checking.

### **2. Minesweeper**

- **Goal**: Create an AI agent that plays Minesweeper by inferring safe cells and mines based on knowledge.
- **Core Files**:
  - `minesweeper.py`: Implements the Minesweeper game and AI logic.
  - `runner.py`: Provides a graphical interface using **Pygame** to play the game and watch the AI make moves.
